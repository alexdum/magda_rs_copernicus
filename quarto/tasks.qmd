## Tasks

Hi Alexandru,

 

As discussed on slack, we changed the projections for each site to the following:

**Italy pilot site à WGS84 / UTM zone 32N \[EPSG:32632\]**

**France pilot site à WGS84 / UTM zone 31N \[EPSG:32631\]**

**Romania pilot site à WGS84 / UTM zone 35N \[EPSG:32635\]**

The ROI shapefiles will be put in the right projection again on the FTP.

Furthermore, we are doing a soil moisture test with our Hydrological model.

For this we have requested the following datasets earlier to be put onto the FTP:

The timeframe we want to test the model in is Jan-2015 to Dec-2022.  

### Surface Soil Moisture -- SSM (CGLS) - done

### NDVI (CGLS) - done

### Soil Water Index -- SWI (CGLS)

### Surface Soil Moisture; ASCAT-B-NRT-O12.5 (H16)

### Root Zone Soil Moisture; RZSM-ASCAT-NRT-10 (H26)
